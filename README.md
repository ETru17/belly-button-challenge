## Task
In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

### Contributions
-To complete this task I utilized the Plotly website on building charts in Java Script. https://plotly.com/javascript/bar-charts/
https://plotly.com/javascript/bubble-charts/

-I also used ChatGpt to help with the debugging issues, help with the filtering and the slicing of the data. I struggled a bit more with syntax errors in this project, because I found it easy to lose track of brackets, commas, etc.
